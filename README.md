# Sample CorDapp Application

Here we have 3 organisations sending messages to each other.
Nodes are basically running on a single system, however it is easy to change (see Corda's tutorials).

## Run
1. `deployNodes` with Gradle
2. Run `workflows-kotlin/build/nodes/runnodes`
3. `runAliceServer` (and others) with Gradle
4. Use API interface
